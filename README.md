This project uses Rails on Routes to maintain its database and serve information and use React Redux to present content to the user in a single page web application format.


One of the big features of this app is its edit user page which lets the user personalize their accout with a profile picture, background, and other public information.

Some of the biggest challenges in creating this feature were the many different modals and pop up menus that appear to allow the user to fill in certian fields. Specifically, creating modals was a frequent task involved with the create of this page. An overall strong eagerness to learn new CSS techniques to address each individual challenge was my primary means of completing this feature.

Additionally, the ability to add and edit picture and comments are important features. Binding comments to the React state to help keep track of which comment belongs to which post was an pleasent solution to dealing with comments through other means.
